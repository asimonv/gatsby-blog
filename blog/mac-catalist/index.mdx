Some time ago I published an iOS app called <ExternalLink target="_blank" aria-label="Mmmmmm app store link" url="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mmmmmm/id1509150681">Mmmmmm</ExternalLink>, 
which lets the user to generate different wallpapers based on colors they could select or extract from images. <br/><br/>
I use multiple desktops, each one for a certain purpose and sometimes they have the same wallpaper. <br/><br/>
Today I was messing around with different images because I needed to change the wallpaper of one of them so I tried with a couple that I generated with the app and they just fit perfectly to my computer's aspect ratio. <br/><br/>
Then it downed on me: __Why not port the app to macOS?__ðŸ’¡<br/><br/>
I had read that Apple made this easier when they released *"Mac Catalyst"*, but I didn't have much time before to test this out, so now that's FHL @ Microsoft, I gave it
a try. It's actually pretty simple, it took me actually ~10<ExternalLink target="_blank" aria-label="japanese counter for minute" url="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-counter-fun/">åˆ†</ExternalLink>.<br/><br/>

So what do you actually need to do? <br/><br/>

Go to *General -> Deployment Info* and select *iPad + Mac Catalyst*.

If you haven't added <ExternalLink target="_blank" src="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/lsapplicationcategorytype" aria-label="LSApplicationCategoryType url"><code>LSApplicationCategoryType</code></ExternalLink> to your <code>Info.plist</code>, now it's a good time,
since it's required for macOS apps.<br/><br/>

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Now all you have to do is to click on *"Add macOS App"* in <ExternalLink target="_blank" src="https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps" aria-label="App Store Connect">App Store Connect</ExternalLink> just like when you first added the iOS App.
